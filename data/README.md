# Data Directory

## Overview
This directory is intended for storing and managing the data used and produced by the Video to Anime Creator application. It typically includes uploaded video files, processed frames, and any other data artifacts generated during the video to anime conversion process.

## Directory Structure
- **/uploads**: Contains the original video files uploaded by the users.
- **/processed**: Houses the anime-style frames generated by the application.

## Usage
To maintain organization and prevent data loss, follow these guidelines:
- Always upload videos to the `/uploads` subdirectory.
- Save all output frames to the `/processed` subdirectory.

## Data Handling Guidelines
- **Confidentiality**: Ensure that uploaded videos are handled confidentially and are not accessible by unauthorized individuals.
- **Backup**: Regularly back up important data to a secure location to prevent data loss.
- **Access Control**: Manage permissions carefully to restrict who can read, write, or modify the files in these directories.

## Cleaning Up
To avoid excessive use of disk space:
- Set up a routine to clean up old data that is no longer needed.
- Implement file retention policies as necessary to manage storage efficiently.

## Example Scripts
Here are some example commands for managing files within this directory:
```bash
# Move a new video to the uploads directory
mv path_to_your_video.mp4 ./uploads/

# Copy processed frames to a secure backup location
cp -a ./processed/* /path_to_backup_location/
