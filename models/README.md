# Model Setup for Video to Anime Creator

## Overview
This directory contains the machine learning models used by the Video to Anime Creator application. These models are responsible for transforming standard video frames into anime-style images.

## Model Requirements
The application requires pre-trained models that are capable of performing image style transfer. These models should be compatible with TensorFlow or any other ML framework the application uses.

## Obtaining Models
The models can be obtained from various sources, including:
- Public model repositories such as TensorFlow Hub.
- Custom-trained models from datasets suited for style transfer tasks.

### Example Model Download
For instance, you can download a pre-trained TensorFlow model from TensorFlow Hub as follows:

```bash
import tensorflow_hub as hub

# Example for loading a model
model = hub.load('https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2')
model.save('path_to_save_model')
